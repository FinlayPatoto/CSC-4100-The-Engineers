---- PRELIMINARIES ----

This is just the original submission for the design document.
It will mostly have the outlines indicated by the >> symbol
for the group's use and reference for each part of project and
each part's sections. It will be filled out throughout the
project as different parts are completed and implemented.

No outside sources have been used so far. If any are used
they will be added and cited here appropriately.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

struct list waiting_queue;

This struct decleration was used to implement the queue storing the sleeping
threads. It is declared as a global list in the timer.c file.

bool compare_wakeups(struct list_elem* first, struct list_elem* second)

This function was added to order the waiting queue. It's used for inserting 
threads into the queue to determine its placement.

struct thread
  {
    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    tid_t tid;                          /* Thread identifier. */
    enum thread_status status;          /* Thread state. */
    char name[16];                      /* Name (for debugging purposes). */
    uint8_t *stack;                     /* Saved stack pointer. */
    int priority;                       /* Priority. */
    struct list_elem allelem;           /* List element for all threads list. */

    /* Shared between thread.c and synch.c. */
    struct list_elem elem;              /* List element. */

    int64_t wakeup; // Used for sleep without busy wait

#ifdef USERPROG
    /* Owned by userprog/process.c. */
    uint32_t *pagedir;                  /* Page directory. */
#endif

    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    unsigned magic;                     /* Detects stack overflow. */
  };

The wakeup variable was added to thread struct. It determines when
the thread will wake up and helps with the ordering of the waiting queue.

enum intr_level current_level = intr_disable(); 

This was implemented in the timer_sleep() function for breifly disabling the
interrupts. It is used very similarly to the implementation in thread yield.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

The function timer_sleep() still checks the interrupt level and starts 
the timer_ticks, but it then goes on to use the enum for the interrupt 
levels and store the wake up time in the thread structure. It then 
blocks the thread. During this time, the interrupts are disabled to
these changes can be made quickly and atomically. The interrupt handler 
will use the waiting queue to check if any threads need to be woken up.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

The interrupt handler takes the first thread in the waiting queue and checks 
if it is its wake up time. It removes the thread from the list and unblocks 
it at the threads wake up time. Otherwise, it will exit the handler. Other
strategies were implemented like using an if statement to break out of 
the function also doesn't waste time if it is not ready to be removed. 
Since the waiting queue is also ordered, it only has to consider one element.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

This is done by turning off the interrupts breifly to modify shared
variables like the waiting queue itself. Once the thread is added and
blocked, interrupts are turned back on.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

We will be turning off the interrupts, which guarantees that the timer
interrupt will not preempt the thread while modifying the variables
to ensure correct values for the thread being added to the waiting
queue.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We chose this initial design because it avoids busy waiting and should 
improve efficiency. The queue enables us to have necessary work done each
tick and allows the timer interrupt to run quickly and safely. The disabling of
interrupts was also modeled after the thread yield function which was originally
used in the busy waiting while loop. This helped us ensure this use was appropriate.
Finally, we used a sorted list to order the wake ups rather than searching for the 
first, or current, wake up time which is more efficient and might keep timers from
missing a wake up.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

We have not gotten to this part of the project yet for development.
It is assumed at least the thread structure needs to be changed and
a priority queue will need to be added.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

To ensure that the highest-priority thread is woken up first, we assume
we will maintain the waiter list of each lock/semaphore in priority order.
We could use an if statement when that wakes it up.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

This will happen if another function or variable is needed for others
to use. Cannot tell specific events. Nested donation makes me think 
the logic needs to be similar to nested for loops in executions (not 
implemented with a for loop though).

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

lock_release() would have to transfer lock ownership, 
then would need to recalculate Priority, assuming priority donation was used.
The lockâ€™s wait queue is then checked, and the highest-priority thread is 
selected and unblocked. This thread is then scheduled to run and gets the 
lock, making sure that priority-based scheduling is maintained.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

A race condition in thread_set_priority() could occur if a thread updates its 
priority while priority donation is happening, leading to an error. One possible 
approach would disable interrupts during priority updating. If a thread lowers 
its priority, it flags the CPU if a higher-priority thread is ready. You shouldn't 
use a lock because it could lead to potential deadlocks and priority inversion, 
so we think at this time interrupt disabling is the best option possible. 


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We chose this design because it should effectively handle priority inversion with 
the ability to have dynamic priority donation. Using an ordered waiters list helps 
keep the implementation on the simple side and ensures correct thread scheduling, 
and recursive donation supports nested locks.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
