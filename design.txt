---- PRELIMINARIES ----

This is just the original submission for the design document.
It will mostly have the outlines indicated by the >> symbol
for the group's use and reference for each part of project and
each part's sections. It will be filled out throughout the
project as different parts are completed and implemented.

No outside sources have been used so far. If any are used
they will be added and cited here appropriately.

			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

We have not finialized these changes yet to get a working alarm. At this point
in time, we have changed the thread struct to include wakeup times. We have 
also added a queue to hold all the threads that are waiting. We also used an 
enumeration for the interrupt level and the current level for that thread. 
These are done to hold the wait time to run in the background instead of the
busy wait and for disabling interrupts.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

timer_sleep() still gets the interrupt level and starts the timer_ticks,
but it then goes on to use the enum for the interrupt levels and store the
wake up time in the thread structure. It then blocks the thread and disables
the interrupt. The interrupt handler gets the thread in the waiting queue,
if it is not time to wake up yet, nothing happens. Otherwise, it removes the
thread from the list and unblocks it.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

To minimize the time in the timer interrupt handler, we will keep the logic
as simple and efficient as possible. One example would be to quickly get thread 
information at initialization to shorten the delay. Using an if statement to break 
out of the function also doesn't waste time if it is not ready to be removed.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

We avoid race conditions entirely by using a waiting queue 
which will be achieved by putting each thread in the queue to sleep
and re-enabled after the critical region is over.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

We will be turning off the interrupts, which guarantees that the timer
interrupt will not preempt the thread while modifying the variable.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We chose this initial design because it avoids busy waiting and should 
improve efficiency. The queue enables use to have necessary work done each
tick and allows the timer interrupt to run quickly and safely.
Being our first iteration, it could easily be improved.
In theory, this design should meet the requirements, which is why we are
pursuing it.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

We have not gotten to this part of the project yet for development.
It is assumed at least the thread structure needs to be changed and
a priority queue will need to be added.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

To ensure that the highest-priority thread is woken up first, we assume
we will maintain the waiter list of each lock/semaphore in priority order.
We could use an if statement when that wakes it up.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

This will happen if another function or variable is needed for others
to use. Cannot tell specific events. Nested donation makes me think 
the logic needs to be similar to nested for loops in executions (not 
implemented with a for loop though).

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

lock_release() would have to transfer lock ownership, 
then would need to recalculate Priority, assuming priority donation was used.
The lockâ€™s wait queue is then checked, and the highest-priority thread is 
selected and unblocked. This thread is then scheduled to run and gets the 
lock, making sure that priority-based scheduling is maintained.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

A race condition in thread_set_priority() could occur if a thread updates its 
priority while priority donation is happening, leading to an error. One possible 
approach would disable interrupts during priority updating. If a thread lowers 
its priority, it flags the CPU if a higher-priority thread is ready. You shouldn't 
use a lock because it could lead to potential deadlocks and priority inversion, 
so we think at this time interrupt disabling is the best option possible. 


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We chose this design because it should effectively handle priority inversion with 
the ability to have dynamic priority donation. Using an ordered waiters list helps 
keep the implementation on the simple side and ensures correct thread scheduling, 
and recursive donation supports nested locks.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
